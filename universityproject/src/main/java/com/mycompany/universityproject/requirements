"Your projects" (Unclear what this refers to)
Explanations:

Tools are typically smaller utilities or software components designed for specific tasks.
Applications are full-fledged software programs with a broader set of features and capabilities.
File formats like PDF are standards for storing and representing data, not applications themselves.
"Your projects" is too vague to categorize without additional context.
It's worth noting that some items in the list could potentially fall into multiple categories. For example, Excel and Word could be considered both applications and tools, depending on how they are being used.

Additionally, some of these items could be part of a larger suite or productivity package, such as Microsoft Office (which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint) or Google Workspace (which includes Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.).

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional examples to categorize.
